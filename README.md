# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Microsoft Azure - Udemy course
# Project 1

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer in Microsoft Azure course.

In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using Python and AzureML SDK.

The code compares models using Skikit-Learn compared to Azure AutoML run.


## Summary

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline

**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison

**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work

**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up

**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
